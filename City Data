Data contained information about city latitudes and logitudes

Question 1 - Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well 
as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one 
smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY LIMIT 1;
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM Station ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY LIMIT 1;


Question 2 - Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) 
from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%' OR CITY LIKE 'E%' OR CITY LIKE 'I%' OR CITY LIKE 'O%' OR CITY LIKE 'U%';

Questiopn 3 - Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) 
from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u';

Question 4 - Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT (CITY) FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') AND RIGHT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
